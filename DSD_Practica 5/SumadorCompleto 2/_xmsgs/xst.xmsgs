<msg type="warning" file="Xst" num="737" delta="unknown" >Found <arg fmt="%d" index="1">8</arg>-bit latch for signal &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="2">sal</arg>&gt;.
</msg>

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="2371" delta="unknown" >HDL ADVISOR - Logic functions respectively driving the data and gate enable inputs of this latch share common terms. This situation will potentially lead to setup/hold violations and, as a result, to simulation problems. This situation may come from an incomplete case statement (all selector values are not covered). You should carefully review if it was in your intentions to describe such a latch.

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="2169" delta="unknown" >HDL ADVISOR - Some clock signals were not automatically buffered by XST with BUFG/BUFR resources. Please use the buffer_type constraint in order to insert these buffers to the clock signals to help prevent skew problems.
